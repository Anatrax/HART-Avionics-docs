Data Collection & Recovery Systems
===================================
The Data Collection & Recovery Systems record data for post-flight analyses and help recover the rocket after launch. Data from these systems can help diagnose any issues that might have occurred during flight. However, there isn't a lot of space in the rocket. Extra hardware adds weight and cost, and there's always a chance that this hardware will not make it back in one piece, so choose payloads carefully.

Examples of data collection & recovery systems include:

- Motor temperature & pressure sensors
- Flight-event detection (see :doc:`Sequence of Events <../../../../events>` for more details)
- Engineering cameras and microphones
- Dedicated state estimation modules
- GPS beacons

The current data collection & recovery systems are listed below. These include systems under development as well as commecially sourced systems we plan to use:
