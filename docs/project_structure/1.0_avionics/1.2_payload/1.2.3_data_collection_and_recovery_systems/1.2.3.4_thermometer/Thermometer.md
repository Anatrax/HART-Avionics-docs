Thermometer
============
The thermometer records the temperature throughout the flight in order to determine if the temperature inside the rocket is within the operating temperature of the electronic components or if the temperature changes during flight are significant enough to affect the rocket's state estimation. If the effects of temperature are significant enough, then the [HART Flight Controller][flight-controller-docs] will need to include a thermometer for more accurate state estimation.
